# httpproxy

a simple http proxy for helping me request at office network.

## supported methods

- [x] `GET`
- [x] `POST`
- [x] `HEAD`
- [x] `DELETE`
- [ ] `OPTIONS`

## usage

The key parameter is `url`, which is the target URL you want to proxy.
And the `METHOD` will keep in the same with the origin request.Any other parameters 
will be send to `url` with no modified.

There can be many features to be added to this repo, so maybe i can do it better.

And now, just enjoy it.
